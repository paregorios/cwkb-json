Keys for authors and works make use of the unique identifying numbers found in the original CWKB RDF (e.g., where CWBK assigns an identifier like \"http://cwkb.org/work/id/7960/rdf\", the key value \"7960\" appear sin the appropriate JSON \"works\" array). Alternate names and abbreviations for authors, as well as titles and abbreviations for works, have also been replicated, as have external identifiers used by the Perseus Digital Library, the Packard Humanities Institute's online Latin texts, etc. The purpose of this JSON serialization is to facilitate use of the CWKB in web applications and other environments.\"\n",
